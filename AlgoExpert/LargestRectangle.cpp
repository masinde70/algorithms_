 * Largest Rectangle that takes in an array of positive integers representing the heights of adjacent
 *buildings and returns the area of the largest rectangle that can be created by any number of adjacent buildings,
 * including just one building. Note that all buildings have the same width of 1 unit.
 *
 * For example, given buildings = [2, 1, 2], the area of the largest rectangle that can be created is 3, using all
 * three buildings.  Since the minimum height of the three buildings is 1, you can create a rectangle that has height
 * of 1 and width of 3 (the number of buildings). You could also create rectangles of area of 2 by using only
 * the first building or the last building, but these are clearly wouldn't be the largest rectangles.
